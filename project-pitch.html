My project will explore the data behind privilege. Using resources such as the Washington Post's database on police killings to demonstrate the disparities in killing by race of victim, the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show pay discrepancies between male and female employees, and other sources to explore systemic injustices in US society. I want to correlate the disparities between the percent of the population comprised by a certain group and the inequities as they are thus applied to that group's outcomes on various measures.
These initial graphs will then be animated to tell the data evidenced story about how privilege operates in our society.
